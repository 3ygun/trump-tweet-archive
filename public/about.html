<h1 id="banner">Trump Twitter Archive</h1>

<p>The Trump Twitter Archive contains every tweet from @realdonaldtrump since he joined in 2009. The tweets have been pulled directly from Twitter (in early September) and the collection will be updated every few days with the latest from the campaign trail. If any tweets are retroactively deleted, they will remain in the archive.</p>

<p>I built this site because I wanted to easily search through all of Donald Trump’s tweets to see what he thought on a host of issues (especially pre-campaign), and soon realized that there was no easy way to do it. Twitter limits the number tweets you can retrieve to 3200, but with some help from the Internet, I found a way to retrieve all of them, and subsequently created this easily searchable database.</p>

<p>I ended up reading every single entry and grouped quotes and tweets together on the highlights page. I’ll let readers draw their own conclusions about the highlights, and highly encourage everyone to search through the database to see what they can find. If you want to share your search results, there is a "link to this search" button that will generate a link to your specific search. I’d also note that this can be a useful tool for any reporter or blogger who’s looking for Trump’s opinion on whatever issue is at hand. If there’s any feature you would like me to add, please let me know. Thanks for visiting.</p>
